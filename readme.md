# TALKSHOW.js
_a communication tool for non-speaking people_

This is a HTML5 port of [Talkshow](https://github.com/regular/talkshow)

[try (an old version) here](http://regular.github.com/talkshow.js/)

Non-speaking people depend on special devices to communicate with the people that surround them. There are devices on the market that play pre-recorded sound samples by pressing a button and allow the user to change sample sets according to context. However, these special device are ridiculously expensive.

With Talkshow, we try to provide a solution based solely on Open Source software that runs on a cheap Netbook with a touch screen.
